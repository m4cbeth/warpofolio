Optimizing a site for the web—be it AltaVista, AskJeeves, Yahoo!, Google, or ChatGPT—has always been about one thing: content. Meaningful, high-quality content that users want to engage with. The real 'optimization' is trivial but important, boring, work that is simply often neglected. But when both But when both engines, quality content and properly structured metadata, are humming along together. Not only do you get a page that ranks, you get a website that people find themselves on when they're looking for answers to hard questions.

For advisors, that usually means websites that are slow, outdated, or confusing to navigate. Think broken links, clunky mobile layouts, or compliance disclaimers buried where no one can find them. These are simple fixes—but until they’re addressed, no amount of marketing will matter. Quick wins build trust, momentum, and a platform you can actually grow from.",
