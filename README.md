# README



This is the source code for my sales first portfolio site. Realizing I've had years of experience in both sales in the financial services industry, and specific experience managing websites for that sector, I thought I might as well put those arguments into action for myself and see where it goes.

For a reminder to self and the future:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## This App is Deployed on Vercel

Available at [Vercel Platform](https://webdevandseosite.vercel.app/), the source for [www.jarenwhitehouse.com](https://www.jarenwhitehouse.com)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
