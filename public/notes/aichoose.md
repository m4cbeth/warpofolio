let's drill down on the hook, ane tone
let's sort of generalize it to all professionals but still maybe mention financial. and 
something that says, 
how do people find advisors
how to pick a professional
how would you do it? How would you in the 80s? call around research.
how would you in the 2000s google it till you felt comfortable making some aapointments
now adays its you had 10 convos with 10 ais. plus google plus calling around.
Seo has always been hacky. the real trick has always been creating a consistent, cohesive, easy to find and easy to read presentation of yourself, your business and your values. When you do that people come banging down lol. jk.
