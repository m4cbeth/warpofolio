Hi Dave,

I was reviewing your website, and it’s genuinely impressive — the clarity of your positioning, the independence you emphasize, and the way you’ve built trust through education. It’s clear how much thought and care you’ve put into it.

At the same time, I see an opportunity to evolve your site into something more.

Right now, it works well as an interactive brochure or information hub — but it could be more — an active, inviting call to action that encourages visitors to pick up the phone or book a meeting.

With a sharper hierarchy, stronger trust signals, cleaner navigation, a modern, mobile-friendly design, and interactive ways to connect, visitors would not only see your credibility but also feel invited to act.

I’m in a unique position right now — I don’t have any new projects on my plate — and I’d love to help someone whose philosophy I genuinely admire. I’d be happy to start with a sample landing page for free, just to show what’s possible. If it resonates, we could explore refreshing more of your online presence together. Just a glimpse of what a refreshed approach could look like, no strings attached.

Please feel free to check out my website at jarenwhitehouse.com to get an idea of my philosophy and services.

P.S. In reading your site, I was sorry to hear about Lucy. As a first-time dog owner myself, I can only imagine how difficult that must have been.

Sincerely,
j
