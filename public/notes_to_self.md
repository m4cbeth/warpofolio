# Pricing

Don't forget how passionate you are about that philosophy.
I'm just charging for my time.
When we work together, you'll just undertstand how much work my job is,
what I do,
Why you would value it,
and agree of your budget.
The same thing I did, but when I was, "you".

The "you" being _my_ prospect.
The person I'm trying to commuincate to.
Remember: show, don't tell.

Don't say, "I understand" vaguley.
Say I understand discussing fees and value.
Any work we do, you know exactly what you're paying for and why.
Frequent reviews...

And just as I'm doing now, building trust with you,
just as you're reading this site,
feeling like the move makes sense,
you're site could be building trust with your prospects as we speak.

Get started today!
Maybe a final pitch section about "Communicating Your Value"
"I know how hard those fee discusions go, "what are you actually doing for me""
And I anticipate a similar one here,
the difference is my ability to communicate, educate and bring you up to speed
so that your website isn't just some stone tablet on the internet you hope someone finds,

But rather,

It becomes a living breathing part of the process that is your business.
A seedling you give water and light to,
everyday all day.
But you can't afford to handle that yourself,
When done right, you'll be too busy meeting new faces
